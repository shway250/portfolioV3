      <p>Jackson Duhon is a Seattle based full-stack web developer and digital artist. Jackson grew up in Austin, TX; where the days are as long as the tacos are delicious, and Willie Nelson roams the streets singing songs about cowboys he's never met. In 2015 Jackson received a degree from the Music Technology, Interaction, Intelligence, and Design program at the California Institute of the Arts, which is where he first discovered his love of coding and being surrounded by creative weirdos. Jackson recently finished a web development immersive course at General Assembly and is looking for new opportunities in the Seattle tech sector. Jackson's a pretty cool dude, everyone says so.</p>
